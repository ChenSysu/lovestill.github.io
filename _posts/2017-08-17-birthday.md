One of our friend's birthday is about to come. We wanted to celebrate her birthday and give her some presents. 

Unfortunately, the friend told us that she didn’t want to spend birthday, neither receiving any presents from friends.

So we decided to give her some special surprise.

On one day before her birthday, we visited her home. We took away some of her belongings without informing her.

Nothing happened until her birthday.

On her birthday, we gathered and start showing her birthday presents after dinner. After unpacked the first present, she was surprised to see that it is a vase which looks so similar to the one she owns.

Then she unpack the second present, she was screaming while she realised that it is a watch, and shouted, "I have one which is exactly the same as this one!"

She continue to unpack the presents without note anything unusual until she opened one which is a photo of she and her mother taken at the time when she was a child. The photo was decorated in a fine frame. She was crying when she finally realised that all the presents are from her. 

She crying and saying, “I feel like I'm an idiot”.
