  <p>One of his friend’s birthday was about to come. They wanted to celebrate her birthday and gave her some presents.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the friend told them that she didn’t want to celebrate her birthday, neither receiving any presents from friends.</p>

<p>So they decided to give her some special surprise.</p>

<p>On one day before her birthday, they visited her home. They took away some of her belongings without informing her.</p>

<p>Nothing happened until her birthday.</p>

<p>On her birthday, they gathered and started showing her birthday presents after dinner. After unpacking the first present, she was surprised to see that it is a vase which looks so similar to the one she owns.</p>

<p>Then she unpacked the second present, she was screaming while she realised that it is a watch, and shouted, “I have one which is exactly the same as this one!”</p>

<p>She continued to unpack the presents without note anything unusual until she opened one which was a photo of she and her mother taken at the time when she was a child. The photo was decorated in a fine frame. She crying when she finally realised that all the presents are from her.</p>
