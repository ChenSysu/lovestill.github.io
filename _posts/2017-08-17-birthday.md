One of our best friends' birthday is about to come. We want to celebrate her birthday and give her some presents. 

Unfortunately, the friend told us that she didn’t want to spent birthday, neither receiving any presents from friends.

So we decided to give her some special surprise.

On one day before her birthday, we visited her home. We took away some of her belongings without informing her.

Nothing happened until her birthday.

On her birthday, we got together and start showing her birthday presents after dinner. When her unpacked the first present, she was surprised to found that it is a vase which looks so similar to the one she owns.

Then she unpacked the second present, she was screaming while she realised that it is a watch, and shouted, "I have one which is exactly the same as this one!"

She continued to unpack the presented without note anything unusual until she opened one which is a photo of she and her mother taken when she was a child, the phone was decorated in a fine frame. She was crying when she finally realised that all the presents are from her. 

She crying and saying, “I feel like I'm an idiot”.
